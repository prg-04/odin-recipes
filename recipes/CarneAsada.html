    <h3>How to Make Carne Asada Marinade</h3>
    <p>Making this carne asada marinade is so easy: Just combine all the ingredients in a bowl. Reserve 1 cup of the marinade for use after the steak is cooked. Then place the pounded out steak in the marinade and let it sit for 24 hours.</p>
    <h3>How Long to Marinate Carne Asada</h3>
    <p>This recipe calls for a 24 hour marination time, and we agree that 24 hours will produce the most flavorful and moist carne asada. However, overnight, or even a few hours, in the marinade is better than nothing.</p>
    <h3>How to Make Carne Asada</h3>
    <p>After your steak has marinated, pop it on a preheated grill and cook to your preferred doneness. About 5 minutes on each side will yield a medium-rare steak. Pour the reserved marinade over the steak and serve.</p>
